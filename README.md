# FOOD MONSTER

Since I started using VIM motions both in NEOVIM and VSCODE initially it was hard time figuring out all the key bindings.
I made this game to practice motions myself and also for those starting to use VIM.

## COMMON ISSUES

### HOW TO RUN: 

1. Just clone the repo on local machine.
2. This repo is using VITE, TYPESCRIPT, PNPM package manager. 
3. After cloning just run `pnpm install` to get all the dependencies.
4. run `pnpm build` to build project 
5. run `pnpm run dev` to spin dev server.

### GAME IS NOT RUNNING PROPERLY FROM LIVE LINK? : 

1. Open the link either in the incognito mode or a fresh browser where extension like Vimium doesn't affect the game.
